LDAP
====

This reconciler for [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) can match given strings agains a LDAP
directory.

Requirements
------------

You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) (2.7, Python 3 will not work) with the following modules
installed. If you don’t have the modules try to install them via `pip`. But is recomended that you use the packaging system of your OS (like `apt-get` on Ubuntu). If you
don’t have `pip` try:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
python -m easy_install pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   [ldap](https://www.python-ldap.org/)  
    `pip install python-ldap`

-   [yaml](http://pyyaml.org/)  
    `pip install PyYAML`

-   flask  
    `pip install Flask`

Usage
-----

Start the service on the command line, you need to pass a configuration file for
each instance:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
python ldap-reconcile.py ldap-users.yml  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the service has started just add a OpenRefine reconciliation service with
the local URL. This should be `http://localhost:5000/ldap-reconcile` by default.

Configuration
-------------

There are several possible settings in the configuration file.

### Connection

-   `host` - The LDAP URI for the host

-   `base` - The bind DN

-   `password` - The password

### Service settings

-   `self_port` - The port the service should listen on

### Search settings

-   `search_base` - The base DN to search from, all searches include the whole
    subtree.

-   `exact_match_score` - If this is set, results will be filtered depending on
    their score, 0 means no filtering.

-   `search_filter` - A dictionary which contains the LDAP fiter as a key and
    another dictionary as value. This dictionary has the following keys:

    -   `score` - The score a match will get.

    -   `operation` - A string manipulation which needs to be done for the
        search string is applied to the filter.

    -   `devide_by_matches` - Will divide the score by the number of matches.

    -   `name` - The LDAP attribute the Name is taken from.

-   `id` - Sets which attribute will be used as ID of a possible match.

-   `search_attrs` - A list of attributes to return.

Examples
--------

There are to example configurations provided:

-   `ldap-users.yml` - This example uses the LDAP attributes `gecos`, `name`,
    `cn` for exact matches and also looks for the `sn` attribute but scores
    matches there quite low. Use this example if you need simple string
    manipulations.

-   `ldap-mail.yml` - This example tries to get matches from email addresses.
